# ðŸ“¦ Blish HUD Current Templates
Current Templates module is a [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com/) module which displays active build and equipment template names based on Guild Wars 2 API data. This module requires API key with `account`, `characters`, `inventories` and `builds` scopes.

**WARNING**: The data from GW2 API is not always up-to-date. When you change your active template, it may take up to **5 minutes** before the change is visible in the API (and as a result, in this module).
